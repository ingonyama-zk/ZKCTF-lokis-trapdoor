# Loki’s trapdoor

After successfully breaking into Loki’s vault and getting access to some of his finest treasures and weapons, you spot a small trapdoor under a carpet. The trapdoor is locked and contains a device with a PLONK prover. It says: “Prove that the point $(1,y)$ belongs to the elliptic curve $y^2 = x^3 + 4$”. You see that, in order to prove this, you need that $y^2 - x^3 - 4$ is equal to zero, which corresponds to the circuit for the prover provided by Loki. Can you open the trapdoor?
